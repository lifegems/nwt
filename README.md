## some plans
I would like to have an online bible that allows the following:
* Creation of notes - support many notes per verse(s)
* Links to videos, artwork, webpages
* Ability to add cross refs (directly to a scripture, in notes)
* Multiple outlines/summaries of books, chapters
* Time periods of event

## additional possiblities
* Map notes for locations


## Idea for building
* Have a simple reader for the scriptures
* Add note button
  * Maps
    * Location
    * Same names
  * Videos
    * Link to video
    * Description
  * Cross-refs
    * Type
    * Scripture

    * Link to artwork
  * Basic note / Explanation / Application
    * Description
